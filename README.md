# image-to-text

Recently I have found it very useful (and effecient) to just use Windows Snipping tool and some sort of Image - to - Text website to copy large sections of text, either from images/videos/documents where it is impossible or impractical to select with the cursor. 

However, these websites are loaded with ads and potential malware, and are ususally limited in their ability (outside of having support for multiple images, which in my specific use case is not necessary)

What this script accomplishes is a simple commnad-line workaround to this problem, that is quick to execute and powerful for what it does. 

How it works:

  -- use Windows Snipping tool to select all the text from the image you want to extract
  
  -- call extract.py from windows command line (save extract.py in the default cmd directory for maximum effeciency)
  
  -- congratulations! the text you want to use is now placed inside your clipboard, ready to be pasted anywhere you need it!
